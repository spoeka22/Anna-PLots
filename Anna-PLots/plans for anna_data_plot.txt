Programme:

structure:
2 files:

"interface": selection of data
for now: insert names of files by hand
to do: insert folder -> finds files automatically and lets you choose which ones you want to choose

possibilites for selection: which data plot together, kind of data (-> automatic recognition?), colours, 2nd x-axis, 
legend coloumns etc. -> for saving

maybe necessary to define different plot types, i.e. type "scanrate" -> different scanrates coloured differently,
"potential range" -> different potential range coloured differently, "conditions" -> depending on something mentioned in the
filename different 

possibility to save plots directly as jpg and pdf and possibly other formats

"main":
built up of functions
-> probably one for each of the parameters you choose


Data import into dictionary of DataFrames (or DataFrame of DataFrames, what seems to make more sense)
CVs: automatic addition of coloumn for potential/RHE -> possibility to change the potential in "interface" section
so that the variations in the reference electrode/use of different ref electrode can be considered

removal of columns that are not necessary to save space and to avoid confusion with data that is not necessary?



PLOTS:
general: try and make understanding of legend as easy as possible. add annotations, arrows etc to the graphs!!
 



steps to do by the programme:
function A:
1)import data from file -> loop through all the files in the list; automatically change potential to pot/RHE
2)append relevant data to DataFrame -> double indexing of coloumns -> 1&2 in one function BUT second part specific for 
	cvs / ocv / etc

function B:
3)modify data - optional
  examples: integrate in a certain region; find double layer capacitance
function C:
4)print data + optional annotations
